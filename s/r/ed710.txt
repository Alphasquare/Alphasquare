Here's a free script for easy running of the Linux XAMPP panel.

It's easy to use. Just save this on  a text file and mod it as executable, then click it.

#!/bin/bash

echo 'Welcome to the opener for XAMPP, by Alphasquare. Please input your password when requested.'
sudo '/opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run'
