That's for the prica site which was canceled a while ago(but their still under my control), not mine.
So you have no involvement with *********.
But I am reducing the second stipulation to 0% seeing I have that right.
And since I'm not using the names "Prica" or "Jellii" don't expect a link back. 
I'm not using prica anytime soon.

Bad actions lead to bad consequences... Karma will get you sooner or later or I will beat karma to it. I won't rest till I beat you (if you ever are successful because arrogance leads nowhere). You say you're better than everyone but you still lack VERY BASIC reasoning skills. Even my grandfather can do better than that. You're on denial.

I will simply chase the life Steve Jobs taught me: innovate till you die, and don't follow currents.
