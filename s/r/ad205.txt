Hello,

Well I won't make this a usual crappy apology letter, just because that's not my style.
Sorry to Cody, I shouldn't have acted that way and I accept it. I was sorta rude. 
But that does not mean you weren't. You simply wouldn't look at the other side of the paper. And it's not just me, I've seen various people
saying that suddenly after you got admitted by Anthony you suddenly became, I quote from a message I received, "Anthony's most loyal follower". 

Still please take this as a token of apology from my end as I definitely shouldn't have acted that way. It's just that Twii has been so tense lately it gets me anxious, and I explode on people. I did not mean to call your problems bull feces. Still, other people do have problems. I know I've said this a million times but, again, take it and reconsider becoming friends like the old times. I'd really appreciate it as you've always been helpful, and flat out a great person. 

Now, shifting from the apology topic:

TWII. 

These are the main problems I have with Twii and Anthony: 

1. TENSE. It makes me anxious and many other people; I quote some messages I've gotten over time (you've probably seen them, no names said though to protect them):

"Yeah. It's gotten kind of tense lately. Everyone's on everyone's backs."

True.

"He (Anthony) actually kind of seems to be feeding the fire. Going off when people tell him their opinions and such."

2. Immatureness. I'm not calling myself the most mature person in humanity but, hell, what he did, is off. It's not an action I'd expect from a grown, mature, 21 year old. I'm not at that age yet, and I wouldn't have done that. Sometimes he's flat out immature.

3. Opinions: Sometimes people feel that you never listen. I get what you're going through; but still man. If you don't listen, people are going to shift out of here, in boatloads. The user is always right. Yet, I'm not telling you to listen to everybody. Don't get it that way.

Hopefully with some opinion somebody will take the initiative to resolve some issues and alleviate the tension.

Again sorry to the offended ones.
