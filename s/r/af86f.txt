Johnny Leach3 hours ago
that was the farthest thought in my head
Johnny Leach3 hours ago
i don't plan to steal anyone from any project
Johnny Leach3 hours ago
i like to see what other coders skills are
Johnny Leach3 hours ago
when i said that those were two completely different thoughts
Johnny Leach3 hours ago
i wouldn't do that
Johnny Leach3 hours ago
i wasn't trying to steal nathan at all
Sergio 3 hours ago
Don't mess with my development company.
Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Sergio 3 hours ago
You're gonna steal my volunteers, eh? Interesting tactic
Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Sergio 3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago
i'm not a good communicator, i probably said something wrong
Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago

Johnny Leach3 hours ago
