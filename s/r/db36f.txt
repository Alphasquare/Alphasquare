****************************
DEDICATED TO NATHAN LOOOL
Here are a few parts of my FB chats with Jeremy, for your entertainment & enjoyment. I'll add notes on the way
****************************
Farewell everybody.
I've been chasing dreams of a successful website.
I'm no longer procrastinating. Things are just about done and ready to go!
For about three years I've had plans of launching my website and it required four other websites... two are finished(one being bannerbits, formerly ran by sergio... anything posted from there on isnt me)
If you have me on facebook I've probably unadded you.
Email: CraftingPixelsWebDesign@gmail.com
The next time you see me will be on a tecrunch (note: amazing grammar thar and HA yeah ok) interview article on my empire.
Shout outs:
@Joey - I like what you did with TCP... keep it going!
@Cody - You got the skills, I had the same problem. The key is simply doing what matters. Don't watch any tv/anime/youtube/etc, don't go on facebook, twitter, buddyweb, etc... just code. When you're finished with postreme I'd like you to email me.
@Leonhitchens - I like that site you got going there...
@AnthonyRossbach - Bro I'd have to say you are really good at coding and I like your style. I'll be emailing you after my sites launch about some stuff. 
@Frank - You've dropped the ball... enough said.
@Zane - I just added you on facebook, accept the request bro... stuff we need to talk about a bit.
@Sergio - I see you. Enough said.
@JamesWhitworth - Ma nigga... not really but keep shit going.
@Niall - You have the name of a Juan-Direction member. Haha,
@Neq3 - I've always thought of you as a distant cousin I never talked to... haha not really but I had to give you a shout out
@MatthewCMeldin - cya bro.
@RxNet - Message me on facebook Red.
@ibuildpixels - I just liked your fb page... Add me.
@Carter - Nice with with find the code
@Nathan - Enjoy life bro... hmu on fb some time.

Currently converting all my code to mysqli

oop is easy
manual is better though
Jonathan Ringe

That's for the prica site which was canceled a while ago(but their still under my control), not mine.
So you have no involvement with ------.
But I am reducing the second stipulation to 0% seeing I have that right.
And since I'm not using the names "Prica" or "Jellii" don't expect a link back. 
I'm not using prica anytime soon.

Bad actions lead to bad consequences... Karma will get you sooner or later or I will beat karma to it. I won't rest till I beat you (if you ever are successful because arrogance leads nowhere). You say you're better than everyone but you still lack VERY BASIC reasoning skills. Even my grandfather can do better than that. You're on denial.

I will simply chase the life Steve Jobs taught me: innovate till you die, and don't follow currents.

And, good thing I never told you my big idea... Soon it'll be implemented on Alphasquare. Good luck and have a good  night

I'm just going to put ---- on a regular shared hosting

Jonathan Ringe
11/23, 8:51pm

Jonathan Ringe
it'll overgrow it quick. shared hosting can NOT handle more than 5000 members.

Jeremy Ford
11/23, 8:51pm

Jeremy Ford
Cause that will hold like 2000 members at first so it'll be good enough for the first week during just posting the links on social media sites our selves
Or I may get a new vps
______________________________________________________________________________
You see some references to emailing about sites, etc. He wanted to acquire all those sites he was talking about, including Twii, for your proof: 

Jeremy Ford
post design sucks
I actually just hate their layout in general
not really the post design
But his homepage is getting better

Jeremy Ford
Twii is the first website we take off the map [NOTE: He meant he wanted to acquire it.]





HE also hated most people on BW. Examples:

Jeremy Ford
I quit buddyweb because being on there holds me down.
Everyone on there sucks shit and wont go anywhere with coding except MAYBE frank if he actually plays his cards right...
I talk to you because you're the only person there who has "it"
There's a skill of web design and a talent of web design
I still don't know which one I have, people say I'm the best and that my works the best but I think all my designs suck so I'ma stick with being a developer instead of a designer...

10/22, 10:11pm
Jeremy Ford
Fucking... earth, rxbrand, yitzy, etc... just some bum ass designers
So idk about trying to get anyone on the team anymore
For now it's you and I...

Jeremy Ford
Cody is a skilled designer. 

Jonathan Ringe
yeah, he has "it"

Jeremy Ford
Not talent, skill..
