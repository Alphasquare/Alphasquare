I just sent a letter to this campaign... I understand the purpose but I NEVER sacrifice feats or stability so that some soccer mom with Windows 95 can see my site.

Hello,

I recently came across your campaign here. As a web developer, I find it idiotic for us to spend 5+ hours making our sites, that depend on the latest technologies, compatible so that someone who hasn't cared enough to upgrade their browser be able to see the site. Like seriously, if there's a basic rule in web design, NEVER SACRIFICE PERFORMACE/UX/UI for Internet Explorer (or any shitty browser) compatibility. It's ridiculous, and takes HOURS to do. So simply don't. Instead, why not focus in giving the users better features and stability? Makes sense eh?

Concerned developer,
