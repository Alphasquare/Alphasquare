This was the code before:

[code]          
 success: function(data)
 {
     $.get('resources/posts');
     $('#pst').prop('disabled', false);
     $('#pst').val('');
 }
[/code]

There you see it was requesting the posts view from resources, but doing nothing with the data. Which meant
that it had to wait 15 SECONDS for Quasar to reload the view and slowed down, plus add the weight of loading the view, because of no infinite scrolling. I fixed it and now it is slightly faster on older accounts... And blazing fast on new accounts, with less content on the posts view.
