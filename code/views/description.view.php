        <p>1 class fits all. Creating a connection to MySQL is as easy as creating
            the Zeam object. Plus, it comes with more features, including a custom
            logging engine. Also, comes with an optional session manager. In fact, it's so awesome, this website runs on it.</p>

         <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i> Logging</h5>
        <p>Because "it" happens. Zeam comes with a nifty optional logging engine.
            Just turn it on when creating the object. If it's off, it also turns off
            PHP error reporting for production.</p>

        <p>Faster than light. Literally. Zeam comes with a nifty optional logging
            engine. Just turn it on when creating the object. If it's off, it also
