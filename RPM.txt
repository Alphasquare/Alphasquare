Okay guys this is the workplan...

First: grab GIT-FTP from GH and install it, it's required.

Use the FTP creds I emailed you, Nathan.

Assigned jobs:

Me:

--Request verification && anti-forced request systems
--Profiles
--Other crap
--Other pages
--BitBucket
--Dezign (<-- lol)

Nathan: 

--Discussions (critical)
--Code fixes
--AJAX (includes infinite scrolling, optimizing, etc.)
--Other crap

Nick:

--Srinivas. Try and establish a business relationship with the guy and after that we'll get him to promote us, it's the only weapon against others.




Memo:

Kyle is GETTING THE LEAD... We cannot let Hylus beat us to it... 

Go team.

BTW Nathan inform me when you finish with Gifavs.
